Hundreds of warriors had tried to take down the fiend but the fiend had hide so thick that no weapon could pierce it. The Crusader met with an old man who told him to forge a crystal sword if he wanted to defeat the demon.  All the other warriors had laughed at the old man.

And when the Crusader subsequently shattered the sword upon a rock, the demon likewise shattered, destroyed by the sword's magic!
